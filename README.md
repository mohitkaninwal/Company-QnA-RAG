## How It Works

1. **Document Preprocessing**  
   Company documents are read and chunked into meaningful sections.

2. **Embedding**  
   Each chunk is embedded using `sentence-transformers` and stored in Pinecone for fast similarity search.

3. **Query Handling**  
   When a user asks a question via the Streamlit interface:
   - The query is embedded
   - Relevant document chunks are retrieved from Pinecone using vector similarity

4. **Answer Generation**  
   LangChain uses the Groq API to generate a concise and accurate answer in a professional HR tone using the retrieved context.
